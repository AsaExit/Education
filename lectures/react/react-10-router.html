            ### Navigation
            * React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
            * Using React Router the developer can manage views (pages) in one single place and at the same time define the routes (urls) in the application.
            * Instead of using
            ```HTML
            <a href="/">link</a>
            ```
            we switch to
            ```HTML
            <Link to="/">link</Link>
            ```
          </script>

                  return <h2>Home</h2>;

              ```HTML
              <BrowserRouter>
              <Router>
              keeps your UI in sync with the URL

              <Link>
              Provides declarative, accessible navigation around your application.

              <NavLink>
              A special version of the <Link> that will add styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.

              <Route>
              Basic responsibility is to render some UI when a location matches the route's path.

              <Switch>
              Renders the first child <Route> or <Redirect> that matches the location.
              ```
            </script>

              ### Router (BrowserRouter)

              A ``` <Router> ``` that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.

              Attribute: basename
              basename sets a new “start url" (base url) for all routed links and navigation.
              Example below renders ``` <a href="/calendar/today"> ```

              ```HTML
              <Router basename="/calendar">
                <Link to="/today"/>
              </Router>

              // Attribute: to

                  pathname: "/courses",

                  * The Route component is perhaps the most important component in React Router to understand and learn to use well. Its most basic responsibility is to render some UI when a location matches the route's path (location is the url in web browser address field).
                  * Route is a container for displaying a view component (page). Depending on the attributes set on the <Route>; zero, one or multiple <Route>'s are rendered, depending on current location.

                * How is this different than just using a bunch of ``` <Route> ```s?
                * ``` <Switch> ``` is unique in that it renders a route exclusively. In contrast, every ``` <Route> ``` that matches the location renders inclusively.

            The location object represents where the app is now, where you want it to go, or even where it was.

            The router will provide you with a location object in a few places:
            * Route component as this.props.location
            * Route render as ({ location }) => ()
            * Route children as ({ location }) => ()

            * **action**: (string), the current action (PUSH, REPLACE or POP)
            * **location**: (object), the current location
            * **push**(path, [state]): (function), pushes a new entry onto the history stack
