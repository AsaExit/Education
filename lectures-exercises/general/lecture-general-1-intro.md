#### What is a front end developer?</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Front-end web development</b>, also known as <b>client-side</b> development is the practice of producing <b>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</b> for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website <b>change constantly</b> and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.<br><br>

						The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the <b>users</b> open up the site they see the information in a format that is <b>easy to read and relevant</b>. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large <b>variety of devices</b> with varying <b>screen sizes</b> and <b>resolutions</b> thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in <b>different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device)</b>, which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.<br>(<a href="https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/what-is-a-FD.html">Front end masters</a>)</p>
