#### Angular Modules (NgModule)

* Bundles functionalities of our app (collects related code into a functional set).
* Usually a group of related components and/or services.
* Every Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules and always has at least a root module.
* Examples of different modules inside an app: Admin, Users, Authentication
* NgModule, HttpClientModule, FormsModule, BrowserModule -> Angular modules

#### Components

* Components define views. 
* A view is a set of screen elements.
* Angular can modify these elements according to your program logic and data.
* An Angular application consists of multiple components.
* Angular Components are TypeScript Classes.

#### Services

* Typically a class.
* Logic not related to a specific view.
* Services can be injected into Components.
* Examples of functionality in services can be: Fetch and handle data, store user example.

#### Angular Router

* The Angular Router is a NgModule
* It that enables navigation from one view (components) to the next as users perform application tasks.
* In other words it decides which components to show.
* The url/address field will update as usual.
* The user will not notice that the app is single page.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

#### Group Exercise

* Find a web application (Ping pong, gmail, google drive).
* Divide application into Components, Services and Modules.
* Draw, print screen etc.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### Hints

* See components as views.
* Services contain logic not related to a specific view.
* Can you chunk logic (components & services) in a module? And reuse in another application?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### Angular CLI

* Is a command line interface for creating angular applications.
* It makes it easy to create an application that already works, right out of the box.
* Which follows best practices!
* With it you can generate components, routes, services and pipes with simple commands.
* And makes it easy to test your app locally while developing.
&nbsp;
